The LED Strip Controller is a RP2040 (Pi Pico) based controller for a 12V DC LED strip we had lying around. Instead of
spending Â£20 on a cheap controller, why not spend much more (and countless hours) on making our own absurdly overengineered
one!?

## Firmware

The firmware, located in `firmware` is WIP.

## Hardware

### PCB

The entire controller is based around one PCB available in the `hardware/board` directory. It is designed using KiCad.

### Box

There is a box that can be 3D printed to fit the PCB and its components well. It is in the `hardware/box` directory, and
was designed using FreeCAD.
